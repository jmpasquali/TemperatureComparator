# TemperatureComparator
LM35 temperature reading with PIC18F4550.

Reads 2 digit temperature from LM35 and prints to 7seg displays. Compares temperature of the first sensor with two other LM35  via analog comparator. If the temperature read is equal to the one read by the other sensors, one LED will light up, indicating which.
